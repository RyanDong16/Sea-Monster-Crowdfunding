# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Crowdfunding*

Submitted by: **Ryan Dong**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [X] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [X] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- In the CSS code, I changed the color of the text to make the Stats section for appealing and striking for the user. Alongside the illuminating Stats box, the design is to help bring more attention causing more people to donate.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The prework was difficult to complete since I'm not too familar with JavaScript. Currently, I'm in week 5 of taking WEB101 therefore, the prework was almost completely new to me except for the html and the css. I strongly ultized ChatGPT to help me finish the prework. I also had to reread the pdf instructions multiple times because I didn't quite understand what it was asking. Finding the key to unlock the next pdf was also frustrating whenever I didn't get a part of the key correct.
